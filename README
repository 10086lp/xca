-------------------=[ XCA ]=---------------------


A graphical userinterface to OpenSSL.
handling keys, generating Certificate signing requests,
handling of client and root-certificates,
as well as handling multiple CAs with signing , CRL
and certificate templates.



Requirements:
==============

for compilation, you need the following Libraries:

QT          >=  2.2.4  from http://www.troll.no
BercleyDB   >=  3.3    from http://www.sleepycat.com
OpenSSL     >=  0.9.6  from http://www.openssl.org

GNU C++ compiler >= 2.95
GNU make



Installation:
=============

Configuration:
--------------
XCA comes with its own configuration tool that has no
relationship with the GNU "autoconf" and "automake" tools.
Just the naming and invokation looks like it. Thus the
usual way to configure and build a Package is the same:
$ ./configure; make; make install

If you have a special setup, you can predefine the following
variables: CC, LD, STRIP, CFLAGS, prefix, basedir. e.g.:
$ CC="ccache gcc" STRIP=: CFLAGS="-Wall -g" prefix=/opt/xca ./configure
to have a cached build and to not strip xca when installing it.
XCA expects the images and translationfiles in /opt/xca/share/xca/
and installs itself to /opt/xca/bin/

"basedir" is the Directory where user dependend settings and her
database is stored.
There should not be any need to change this.
If it is not defined it defaults to $HOME/xca this can be changed at runtime
with the switch -b.

The header and library files were searched in:
"$QTDIR /usr /usr/X11R6 /usr/local"
and all directorys supplied at the commandline of configure.
The QT installationdir should not be supplied at the CMDline of configure
but rather written to the $QTDIR environment variable as it is done
with the most distributions.

If for example your shiny recent QT is in /usr/local/lib/qt-X11-3.2.0
and your new OpenSSL is installed in /usr/local/ssl
invoke configure like this:
----------------------------------------------
$ export QTDIR=/home/chris/aaa/src/qt-x11-free-3.2.0
$ ./configure /usr/local/ssl
Found: db_cxx.h at /usr/include
Found: libdb3_cxx.so at /usr/lib
Found: qobject.h at /home/chris/aaa/src/qt-x11-free-3.2.0/include
Found: libqt.so at /home/chris/aaa/src/qt-x11-free-3.2.0/lib
Found: openssl/opensslv.h at /usr/local/ssl/include
Found: libcrypto.so at /usr/local/ssl/lib
The Versions of the used libraries are:
        OpenSSL 0.9.6c 21 dec 2001
        Sleepycat Software: Berkeley DB 3.2.9: (April  7, 2002)
        QT: 3.2.0
$
---------------------------------------------

This writes all found settings, vars and headers to
"Local.mak".

After Local.mak was created by configure it can be used
and modified for your needs.

Building:
-----------
The Makefiles do support parallel builds (-j)
targets:
all, xca :  builds the app
install  :  installs the app
headers  :  UICs the headers in ui/ needed by other files.
clean    :  deletes all builded files
distclean:  deletes also Local.mak


Installing:
------------
make destdir=/my/virtual/root
provides /my/virtual/root/ as root-directory for installation
to be mounted by others as root or to be chroot'ed to.



Running/invoking:
=================

a detailed manual can be found in docs/
